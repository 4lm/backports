dcp_inspect (backport from dietrich codebase) will inspect DCP volumes and directories.


Usage:  dcp_inspect /path/to/dir
        dcp_inspect --help

For convenience this backport carries all required infrastructure,
including Julik's Timecode library (https://github.com/guerilla-di/timecode).

2 external requirements:
  - asdcplib
      http://www.cinecert.com/asdcplib/
  - Nokogiri, a Ruby gem used for XML parsing
      http://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html

Couple of todo's lurking:
  - Consistency checks of package formats (Interop/SMPTE)
  - Checks of listed and actual asset sizes
  - Checks and verification of Signature/Certificates
      For now dcp_inspect will just report Signer info
  - Some Assetmap options (Offsets, volume indices) are not handled

Developed and tested on linux boxes. Let me know if dcp_inspect actually runs in Windows.
