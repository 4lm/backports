dcp_inspect will inspect DCP volumes and directories.


Usage:  dcp_inspect /path/to/dir
        dcp_inspect --help

Alpha stage so don't expect miracles. But it does bend over backwards to find 
problems in packages.

For convenience this backport carries almost all required infrastructure,
including Julik's Timecode library (https://github.com/guerilla-di/timecode).

2 external requirements:
  - asdcplib and its cli tools
      http://www.cinecert.com/asdcplib/
  - Nokogiri, a Ruby gem used for XML parsing
      http://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html

Couple of todo's lurking:
  - Consistency checks of package formats (Interop/SMPTE)
  - Checks of listed and actual asset sizes
  - Checks and verification of Signature/Certificates
      For now dcp_inspect will just report Signer info
  - Some Assetmap options (Offsets, volume indices) are not handled
  - Marker lists in CPLs are not handled
  - Its output is quite chatty and for now there is no way to tame that

Tested on linux boxes. Let me know if dcp_inspect actually runs on Mac OS or Windows.
