dcp_inspect will inspect DCP volumes and directories.


Usage:  dcp_inspect /path/to/dir
        dcp_inspect --help

Alpha stage so don't expect miracles. But it does bend over backwards to find 
problems in packages.

For convenience this backport carries almost all required infrastructure,
including Julik's Timecode library (https://github.com/guerilla-di/timecode).

2 external requirements:
  - asdcplib and its cli tools
      http://www.cinecert.com/asdcplib/
  - Nokogiri, a Ruby gem used for XML parsing
      http://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html
    Nokogiri implies the presence of libxml2

Schema validation: As of v1.2011.12.10.backport dcp_inspect will require
xsd/ next to it. If you git clone git://github.com/wolfgangw/backports.git
everything will be in place.

Export env XML_CATALOG_FILES=/path/to/backports/xsd/catalog.xml
to make use of local catalog lookup. Actually dcp_inspect will bail out
if XML_CATALOG_FILES is not set.

Couple of todo's lurking:
  - Consistency checks of package formats (Interop/SMPTE)
  - Checks and verification of Signature/Certificates
      For now dcp_inspect will just report Signer info
  - Some Assetmap options (Offsets, volume indices) are not handled
  - Marker lists in CPLs are not handled

Tested on linux boxes. Let me know if dcp_inspect actually runs on Mac OS or Windows.
