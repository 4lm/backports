dcp_inspect (backport from dietrich codebase) will inspect DCP media and directories.

Usage:  dcp_inspect /path/to/dir
        dcp_inspect --help

Developed and tested on linux boxes. Let me know if dcp_inspect actually runs in Windows.

For convenience this backport carries all required infrastructure,
among it Julik's Timecode library (https://github.com/guerilla-di/timecode).

The only external requirement so far is Nokogiri.
See http://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html for a guide on
how to install Nokogiri in Mac OS X, Ubuntu, Red Hat and Windows
